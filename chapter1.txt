The narrator of The Great Gatsby is a young man from
 Minnesota named Nick Carraway. He not only narrates 
 the story but casts himself as the book’s author. He
  begins by commenting on himself, stating that he lea
  rned from his father to reserve judgment about other 
  people, because if he holds them up to his own moral
   standards, he will misunderstand them. He characteri
   zes himself as both highly moral and highly tolerant
   . He briefly mentions the hero of his story, Gatsby,
    saying that Gatsby represented everything he scorns
    , but that he exempts Gatsby completely from his us
    ual judgments. Gatsby’s personality was nothing sho
    rt of “gorgeous.”
